So I'm going to spend the next thirty days designing and publishing a brand new static website. Start to Finish,for less than $500 dollars. I will take you through the process of constructing the website, step-by-step; everything from choosing a domain name, to having it show up in the Google search engine result pages,[SERPs](http://www.wordstream.com/serp). The outline shown below is the key to getting this task accomplished on time and on budget.

 **30 Day Road Map** 
*Day One: Plan your Work, Work your Plan*
*Draw the blueprint first, swing the hammer last.*
Every good Architect knows; it is easier to change a line on a blueprint, than to move a wall. Same with website designing. Don't build an awesome website and then find out that your domain name sucks. Don't start with Ruby on Rails and then decide a Wordpress framework makes more sense.

**Day Two: The Right Tools for the Right Job**

Not every site needs industrial strength tools. Choosing the right tools, products and services for the website is an art in itself. Every thing; from your domain name provider, to your web hosting service and everything in between, needs to be chosen with the knowlege of what the purpose of the website is.

**Day Three: All Things Google**
*Google is King in Website Search, your Website needs to be it's Queen.*
Make your website so sexy that Google falls in love with her! Set up you website with Google's free tools so Google knows what it is about. If Google doesn't love your website, nobody else will either.

**Day Four: This Website Under Construction**
*Groundbreaking Ceremony, Future Home of " "*
Announce your website to the world. Start your countdown timer; hours, minutes seconds, until your website is live. Your biggest challenge up to this date, is to have your website live and complete before the timer runs out. (Hint: Start with a 30 day timer, even though you are on day four. It is better to finish early than to be late.)

**Day Five: This Homepage Still Under Construction**
*Hold your pre-construction meeting, i.e. deploy your development site.* 
From this point forward, all development work is done in a development site, not on your live website. You will push up changes to the real website at the end of each day.
 
**Day Six: Menu Pages Still Under Construction**
*Lay the Foundation and Build the Skeleton Framework.*
Build a blank page for each menu item, build with the SEO optimization of each page already in-place.

**Day Seven: Day of Rest**
*Take a break, you deserve it.*
Rome was not built in a week, your website won't be either.

**Days Eight through Twenty-Eight: Content, Content, Content**
*If you build it, will they come? Part One*
Each page of your website has a specific purpose. Make sure that you know what it is and that the page is designed; so that each item on the page is supporting that purpose. This should have all been planned on Day One. If you didn't do it then, do it now. Then spend a day crafting the perfect menu page for each menu item. At the end of every day, post your page and move on to the next one. Only after all the menu pages are designed should you continue creating your website's internal pages.

**Day Twenty-Nine: Google Webmaster Tools and Google Adwords**
*If you build it, will they come? Part Two*
Each page of your website has a specific purpose. Make sure that Google know's what it is. You will implement a Google Adwords campaign to promote the website and it's landing pages. If you don't know what a landing page is this day is for you.

**Day Thirty: Google Adwords Campaign Launch**
*If you build it, will they come? Part Three*
The moment of truth has arrived! You will monitor your website's visitors in real time and keep track of your Adwords spending. At the end of this day, you will have an idea if your website was a success or not. What is success? Only you will know, but you will know it. The rest of our websites life will depend on it. A good Webmaster strives to improve the website each and every day from this day forward.
