title:  "120 Days Into Learning How to Learn"

So I finally finished my first [Learn.co](https://learn.co) project yesterday,
exactly 120 days after starting the program. I am 35% through the program. My initial goal was to complete the program in 5 months, figuring that I could put in 60 hour weeks, non stop for those 5 months. My wife and my body, told me otherwise. I found it almost impossible to sit at my desk for 12 hours a day, five days a week.

# Coding a Simple Game is Quite Hard
When I first started my [TicTacToe](https://github.com/churchwerks/ttt-with-ai-project-v-000) project, I approached it like I do all my lab work. I read the lab outline and then dove right into writing code to pass the Rspec tests. 60 hours of coding later, I have determined that I am no longer going to take that approach.
The main problem with my old approach is that although it is perfectly okay for simple and/or medium difficulty labs, for complex and/or hard labs, it fails miserably. The reason why it fails for me in these instances, is that I need to begin a code session with the end in mind. For example, for the smaller/easier labs, the goal is just pump at code that gets the task done. The task in these cases is to pass the Rspec tests and submit the lab. For the TicTacToe project, the goal was to create a working Command Line Interface (CLI) TicTacToe game, with artificial intelligence. A totally different beast, that required a different approach than what I had been doing. Unfortunately, as I will explain below, I did not recognize that fact, until much to late in my coding process.

# Plan your Work and Work your Plan
The first step in programming my game, should have been working out with pen and paper, the logic of the game using Pseudo Code. I did not do that. Instead, I jumped right in just getting the Rspec tests to pass without thinking about how the bits and pieces of code; I was building, were actually going to work together. I eventually went back to this step after about 50 plus hours of coding, at which time my code was about 90 percent complete. I was extremely frustrated with my spaghetti code, so I did what any good programming student would have done and actually wrote out what I wanted the code to do and then wrote some Pseudo Code on how to do it. I then had a framework for actually finishing the game. Once I had a clear idea of how I wanted my code to actually work, it took me about 4 hours to finish the game.

# The Results Speak for Themselves
So in my game, the computer never loses, either against another computer player, or a human. This game would be very boring, so I set an attribute for the computer player that allows the computer to make a mistake. The human player has the choice to play an Easy or Hard game. In the Easy game, the first two computer moves are totally random. A good human can beat the computer. In the Hard game the computer wins; when the human makes a mistake, or the game will end in a draw.

I would have eventually got to this point in my code. The problem was I, should have got to this same place, 24 hours earlier. Lesson Learned!
