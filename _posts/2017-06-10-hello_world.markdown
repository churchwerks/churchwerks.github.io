I remember how cool it was when I first saw the 1984 Apple Super Bowl commercial on the TV.
Knew then and there that I wanted to learn how to program a computer.

Fast forward 33 years and I am finally taking the plunge!, well sort of. Not a computer per se, but a web application. Here is the first line of Ruby code that I wrote for my first lesson:

```
puts "Hello World!"
```

very simple, very elegant. How cool is that?
