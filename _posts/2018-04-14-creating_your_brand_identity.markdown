I recently starting thinking of my life after I graduate from the FlatIron School. I quickly realized that even though I have come a long way in mastering how to write Ruby on Rails code, I need a way to promote my brand. What follows below is how I have started to tackle that bigger challenge.

Cleaning up your existing Social Media Profiles or starting new ones? That is going to be a question that is going to require some thought. On the one hand you may have a unique handle or very desirable one. For instance if you have a fairly unique full name like I hav, Steven Lennis,  then you might want to keep your Facebook, Google, Twitter, LinkedIn accounts as they are. If you are stuck with @JohnSmith32615 then maybe not so much. Afterall, steven.lennis@gmail.com feels right, slennis5467@gmail.com doesn't.

Securing a domain name with your given name may be a little tough. I have stevenlennis.com for instance, but I bought it a long time ago. Even if you could get johnsmith.com; would anybody know that was you, John Smith? The point is, start thinking about how you want to brand yourself; see if the names are available on the platforms you want, and then secure the rights to them, ASAP! Once you do, never give them up. Commit to never posting anything on them, that you wouldn't be comfortable showing your future employer or your childern.

Choose wisely and Good Luck!
