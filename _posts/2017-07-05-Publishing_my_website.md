## How I spent my 4th of July Holiday

So while most normal people were doing something fun, I spent the first 3 days of July setting up my local development environment to publish my GitHub hosted website as well as my self hosted websites from my iMac. (see my previous  [post](http://chitownblogger.com/2017/07/03/riyadh_blog/))

Now it didn't take the entire 3 days to do that, but throw in the time spent working on my ** HTML and CSS ** module of my
[learn.co Curriculum](https://learn.co/tracks/full-stack-web-dev-with-react/html-and-css/site-publishing/) it was an intense 3 days. I am * HAPPY * to say that I did not work July 4th!
